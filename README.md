# Pause Loop

Pause Loop is a website designed to support health and productivity while working at a computer. I originally created it for personal use but am sharing it in case others find it helpful.

## ðŸŒŸ Description
Pause Loop offers a set of tools to maintain eye health, enhance focus, and improve overall well-being:

* **20/20/20 Timer**: encourages regular eye breaks.
* **Pomodoro Timer**: helps structure work and rest sessions.
* **Brown Noise**: creates a calming background for better concentration.
* **Breathing**: promotes stress relief and boosts overall vitality.

This program makes working at a computer more comfortable and healthier.


## ðŸ›  Installation & Development

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev 
```
This will launch the **React** application. You can access it at http://localhost:3000.
